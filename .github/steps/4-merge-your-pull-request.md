## Step 4: Merge your workflow file

_You're now able to write and run an Actions workflow! :sparkles:_

Merge your changes so the action will be a part of the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your workflow file

1. In your repo, click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Click on the pull request you created in step 1.
1. Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge**.
1. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `welcome-workflow` branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). Another workflow will run and will replace this content with instructions for the next step.

# Hello GitHub Actions

_Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow._

</header>

## Welcome

Automation is key for streamlining your work processes, and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) is the best way to supercharge your workflow.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps engineers, students, managers, teams, GitHub users.
- **What you'll learn**: How to create workflow files, trigger workflows, and find workflow logs.
- **What you'll build**: An Actions workflow that will check emoji shortcode references in Markdown files.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with issues and pull requests, as well as edit files. We recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course first.
- **How long**: This course can be finished in less than two hours.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a workflow
2. Add a job
3. Add a run step
4. Merge your pull request
5. See effect of the workflow

### How to start this course

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=hello-github-actions&owner=%40me&name=skills-hello-github-actions&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

Users can participate in the market value of these coins through various trading pairs offered by exchanges.

### Free Bot and Code
You can create a simple bot using free services like GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, and Telegram or Discord for community engagement.

Here's an example code snippet for creating a basic Telegram bot using Python:

```python
import telegram
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler

# Your bot token from BotFather
bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'

def start(update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="Hello! Welcome to AfricaCryptoChainx!")

updater = Updater(token=bot_token, use_context=True)
dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

updater.start_polling()
updater.idle()
```

This example sets up a basic Telegram bot that responds with a welcome message when the `/start` command is used.

### ACCXBOT
